Windows IoT, formerly Windows Embedded, is a family of operating systems from Microsoft designed for use in embedded 
systems. Microsoft currently has three different subfamilies of operating systems for embedded devices targeting 
a wide market, ranging from small-footprint, real-time devices to point of sale (POS) devices like kiosks. 
Windows Embedded operating systems are available to original equipment manufacturers(OEMs), who make it available to 
end users preloaded with their hardware.
