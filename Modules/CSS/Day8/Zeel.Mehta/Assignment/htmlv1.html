                        Over 10 Opposition parties met for a strategy session for the Lok Sabha on 
                        Thursday, a day ahead of the proposed 15-hour debate on the farmers' issue 
                        in the Rajya Sabha. Earlier this week, the government had offered a 15-hour 
                        discussion. But the opposition objected after Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah 
                        Naidu said the discussion will take place after the debate on the Motion of 
                        Thanks to the President's address.

                        on the farmers' agitation issues and concerns.

                <h3>45% Of India's Healthcare Workers Vaccinated: Health Ministry</h3>
                <p>The government today expressed satisfaction at the pace of COVID-19 vaccinations 
                    s it gets closer to its targets. "We had estimated that we have about one crore 
                    healthcare workers. But when we registered them it was around 96 lakh (96,31,637).
                    43.9 lakh (43,91,826) have already been vaccinated as of 1.30 pm today, which means 
                    45 per cent of India's total healthcare workers have been vaccinated. 
                    This is satisfactory," Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    13 states have vaccinated more than 50 per cent of their healthcare workers, 
                    the top three states being Madhya Pradesh (73.6 per cent), Rajasthan (66.8 per 
                    cent) and Tripura (65.5 per cent).
                    But some others have covered less than 30 per cent of their healthcare workers. 
                    Sikkim is at 29.9 per cent, Jammu and Kashmir at 23.2 per cent, Tamil Nadu at 
                    23.7 per cent and Chandigarh at 22.6 per cent.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        "We are holding virtual conferences with these states and are advising 
                        them on how to improve the numbers," Rajesh Bhushan said.
                         The government today claimed that it was involving the private sector too 
                         in vaccinations as over 1,200 (1,239) private hospitals were already 
                         carrying out vaccinations along with 5,912 government facilities. 
                         They also gave a clarification on questions about vaccine vials expiring.
