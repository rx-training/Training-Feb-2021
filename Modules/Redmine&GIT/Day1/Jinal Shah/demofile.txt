I have created "Jinal Shah" folder
and created one file named "demofile.txt" in that particular folder.
I have commited this file and push it
i'm adding these lines from the github remote repository.
and now i am going to pull this for my local repository.
Take these changes into your localsystem and add more changes after that and then commit
Adding this new lines as per request and now again going to commit and pull request.
