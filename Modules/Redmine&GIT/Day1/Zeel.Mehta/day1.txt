To Discuss Farmers' Issue In Lok Sabha, Opposition Meets Over Strategy. Over 10 Opposition parties met for a strategy session for the Lok Sabha on Thursday, a day ahead of the proposed 15-hour debate on the farmers' issue in the Rajya Sabha. Earlier this week, the government had offered a 15-hour discussion. 
But the opposition objected after Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu said the discussion will take place after the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President's address.
Most parties including the Shiv Sena, National Conference, the Left parties and the DMK were unanimous that given the current situation in the Delhi borders and the continuing agitation, a separate discussion must take place on the farmers' agitation issues and concerns.
Congress's Rahul Gandhi was present throughout the meeting.The opposition has refused to accept the demand for a joint, extended discussion on the Motion of Thanks, as it would not be correct especially since this is a current and important issue.
