differences between fetch and pull 
fetch :- it retrieves all the changes from the rremote repository without integrating them with local repository
pull : it updates your local repository with the changes from the remote repository 

stash :Stash will move your modified files into a stack. So, later in the same or in another branch, you will be able to bring them back and see those modifications in your project.
stage: Stage is the step before to make a commit, you add modified files to "Staged files" to create your next commit.
