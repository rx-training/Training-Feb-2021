        <h1>Google subsea cable set to deliver 250TB data per second</h1>
        <p>San Francisco, The new subsea cable between the US and mainland Europe,
            named after Nobel Peace Prize winner and founder of the Red Cross, Henry Dunant,
             is now ready for service and can transmit the entire digitised Library of Congress
              three times every second, Google has announced.
        
            Crossing the Atlantic Ocean between Virginia Beach in the US and Saint-Hilaire-de-Riez
             on the French Atlantic coast, the system expands Google's global network to add
              dedicated capacity, diversity, and resilience, while enabling interconnection 
              to other network infrastructure in the region.
            
            "We originally announced the Dunant cable is the first long-haul subsea
             cable to feature a 12 fibre pair space-division multiplexing (SDM) design, and will
              deliver record-breaking capacity of 250 terabits per second (Tbps) across the ocean," 
              Chris Ciauri, President, EMEA, Google Cloud said late on Wednesday.
              The historic landing was made possible in partnership with SubCom, a global partner for 
              undersea data transport, which engineered, manufactured and installed the Dunant system 
              on schedule despite the ongoing global pandemic.

              Google first announced this project back in the middle of 2018 and it was expected to go live
               in 2020, but the pandemic struck.
              
              While previous subsea cable technologies relied on a dedicated set of pump lasers to amplify
               each fibre pair, the SDM technology used in Dunant allows pump lasers and associated optical
                components to be shared among multiple fibre pairs.
              
              This 'pump sharing' technology enables more fibres within the cable while also providing
               higher system availability.
              
              The Google Cloud network consists of fiber optic links and subsea cables which will soon 
              include the Grace Hopper subsea cable between more that 100 points of presence, thousands of edge node locations, 91 dedicated interconnect locations and 24 Google Cloud Platform (GCP) regions, with additional regions
               announced in places like Chile, Spain, Italy, France and Poland.</p>
